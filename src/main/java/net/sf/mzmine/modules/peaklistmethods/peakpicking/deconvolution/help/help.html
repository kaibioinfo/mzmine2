<h1>Chromatogram deconvolution</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Following the detection of chromatograms by the Chromatogram builder, chromatograms have to be deconvoluted into individual peaks.
The Deconvolution module provides several algorithms for this purpose.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Suffix</dt>
<dd>This string is added to the end of the name of each processed peak list</dd>


<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>Selection of algorithm for peak recognition</dd>

<dt>m/z center calculation</dt>
<dd>Define measure for center m/z calculation as median, average (weighting=NONE) or weighted-average. 
This function is applied to all data points (m/z, intensity) of the new feature. </dd>

<dt>m/z range for MS2 scan pairing (Da)</dt>
<dd>All MS2 scans within m/z and RT range are allocated to the new feature (ranges as +-value around center)</dd>

<dt>RT range for MS2 scan pairing (min)</dt>
<dd>All MS2 scans within m/z and RT range are allocated to the new feature (ranges as +-value around center)</dd>

<dt>Remove original peak list</dt>
<dd>If checked, original chromatogram will be removed and only deconvoluted version remains</dd>
